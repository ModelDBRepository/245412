Usage instructions:<br/>
-------------------<br/>
Run camk_ltd.py with a command like<p/>
python camk_ltd.py<p/>

 This script will generate .txt data files as Ca_mean.txt, active_CaMKII_mean.txt, AMPAR_mean.txt and PKC_mean.txt which could be plotted with another software tool.<p/>

The figures generated by this script show the mean of 100 iterations of the chemical species activity over time as follows.<p/>
